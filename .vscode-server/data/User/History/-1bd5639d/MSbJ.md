# Verification Fix Summary

## Problem

The contract verification system was unable to verify Uniswap V3 contracts because they rely on multiple imported files. The verification service didn't support file imports, resulting in errors like:

```
Verification failed: Compilation errors: Source "@uniswap/v3-core/contracts/libraries/SafeCast.sol" not found: File import callback not supported
```

## Solution

We've enhanced the verification system to support contract imports by:

1. Creating an import handler that resolves import paths and provides file content to the Solidity compiler
2. Updating the verification service to use the import handler
3. Enhancing the API to accept import mappings as part of verification requests

## Changes Made

### 1. Import Handler

Created a new file `import-handler.ts` that:
- Handles file imports for the Solidity compiler
- Supports direct mappings from import paths to file content
- Supports base path resolution for relative imports
- Provides error handling for missing imports

### 2. Verification Service

Updated the verification service in `index.ts` to:
- Use the import handler for file imports
- Accept import mappings as a parameter
- Pass the import handler to the Solidity compiler

### 3. API Service

Created a new API service in `contracts-verification.ts` that:
- Handles verification requests with import support
- Accepts import mappings as part of the request
- Sets up the import handler with the provided mappings

### 4. Scripts

Created scripts to:
- Apply the verification fix (`apply-verification-fix.sh`)
- Run the verification with import support (`run-verification-with-imports.sh`)
- Verify Uniswap V3 contracts with import support (`verify-uniswap-with-imports.js`)

### 5. Documentation

Created documentation to:
- Explain the verification system with import support
- Provide instructions on how to use the system
- Troubleshoot common issues

## How to Use

1. Apply the verification fix:
   ```bash
   ./apply-verification-fix.sh
   ```

2. Run the verification with import support:
   ```bash
   ./run-verification-with-imports.sh
   ```

3. Or manually verify contracts by providing import mappings in the verification request.

## Benefits

- Ability to verify complex contracts like Uniswap V3 that rely on multiple imported files
- More robust verification system that can handle a wider range of contracts
- Better error messages and troubleshooting capabilities

## Future Improvements

- Add support for automatic import resolution from GitHub repositories
- Enhance the import handler to support more complex import scenarios
- Add a UI for managing import mappings
