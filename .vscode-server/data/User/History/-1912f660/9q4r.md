# Studio Blockchain Verification URLs

Based on the analysis of the mainnet-indexer codebase, here are the URLs you should use in your hardhat.config.js file for contract verification on the Studio blockchain:

## Required URLs for hardhat.config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  networks: {
    studio: {
      url: "https://mainnet.studio-blockchain.com", // RPC endpoint
      chainId: 240241 // Chain ID from config
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      studio: "dummy" // API key is not required but field is needed
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: "studio",
        chainId: 240241,
        urls: {
          // API URL for verification service
          apiURL: "https://mainnetindexer.studio-blockchain.com/api",
          
          // Browser URL for the explorer
          browserURL: "https://explorer.studio-blockchain.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Notes on the URLs

1. **RPC URL**: `https://mainnet.studio-blockchain.com`
   - This is the primary RPC endpoint for the Studio blockchain
   - Alternative RPC endpoints include:
     - https://mainnet2.studio-blockchain.com
     - https://mainnet3.studio-blockchain.com
     - https://mainnet.studio-scan.com
     - https://mainnet2.studio-scan.com

2. **API URL**: `https://mainnetindexer.studio-blockchain.com/api`
   - This is the API endpoint for the verification service
   - The indexer service exposes the `/contracts/verify` endpoint for contract verification

3. **Browser URL**: `https://explorer.studio-blockchain.com`
   - This is the URL for the blockchain explorer frontend
   - After verification, your contract will be viewable at this URL

## Verification Process

When you run `npx hardhat verify`, Hardhat will:

1. Compile your contract with the specified settings
2. Send the compiled bytecode, source code, and other parameters to the API URL
3. The verification service will compare the compiled bytecode with the on-chain bytecode
4. If they match, your contract will be marked as verified

After successful verification, you can view your verified contract at:
`https://explorer.studio-blockchain.com/address/0xYourContractAddress`

## Important Note

If these URLs don't work, please check with your Studio blockchain administrator for the correct URLs. The URLs provided here are based on analysis of the codebase and common naming conventions for blockchain explorers.
