# API Endpoint Options for Studio Contract Verification

You mentioned that the URL "https://mainnetindexer.studio-blockchain.com/api" is returning a 404 error. Based on the codebase analysis and the fact that the browser URL is https://studio-scan.com, here are some possible API endpoints you can try:

## Option 1: Direct API Subdomain
```javascript
apiURL: "https://api.studio-scan.com"
```

## Option 2: API Path on Main Domain
```javascript
apiURL: "https://studio-scan.com/api"
```

## Option 3: API Version Path
```javascript
apiURL: "https://studio-scan.com/v1/api"
```

## Option 4: Verification-Specific Endpoint
```javascript
apiURL: "https://studio-scan.com/api/verify"
```

## How to Test an API Endpoint

You can test if an API endpoint is working by making a simple GET request to it:

```bash
curl -i https://api.studio-scan.com/health
```

Or:

```bash
curl -i https://studio-scan.com/api/health
```

A working API endpoint should return a 200 OK status code.

## Hardhat Configuration Example

Here's an updated hardhat.config.js example with the most likely API endpoint:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  networks: {
    studio: {
      url: "https://mainnet.studio-blockchain.com",
      chainId: 240241
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      studio: "dummy" // API key is not required but field is needed
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: "studio",
        chainId: 240241,
        urls: {
          // Try this API URL first
          apiURL: "https://api.studio-scan.com",
          
          // Browser URL for the explorer (confirmed)
          browserURL: "https://studio-scan.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

If that doesn't work, try:

```javascript
apiURL: "https://studio-scan.com/api"
```

## Ask Your Studio Blockchain Administrator

If none of these options work, please contact your Studio blockchain administrator for the correct API endpoint URL. They should be able to provide you with the exact URL for contract verification.
