# Studio Blockchain Contract Verification Guide

Based on my analysis of the mainnet-indexer codebase, I can provide you with the exact API endpoint and requirements for contract verification on the Studio blockchain.

## API Endpoint for Contract Verification

The correct API endpoint for contract verification is:

```
https://mainnetindexer.studio-blockchain.com/contracts/verify
```

This endpoint accepts a POST request with the following parameters:

```json
{
  "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  "sourceCode": "pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract MyContract { ... }",
  "compilerVersion": "0.8.0",
  "optimizationUsed": true,
  "runs": 200,
  "constructorArguments": "0x...",
  "contractName": "MyContract",
  "libraries": {
    "MyLibrary": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
  },
  "evmVersion": "cancun"
}
```

## Hardhat Configuration

To verify contracts using Hardhat, you need to update your `hardhat.config.js` file with the following configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  networks: {
    studio: {
      url: "https://mainnet.studio-blockchain.com",
      chainId: 240241
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      studio: "dummy" // API key is not required but field is needed
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: "studio",
        chainId: 240241,
        urls: {
          apiURL: "https://mainnetindexer.studio-blockchain.com",
          browserURL: "https://studio-scan.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Verification Command

Once your configuration is set up, you can verify your contract using the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network studio 0xYourContractAddress [constructor arguments]
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues with contract verification, try the following:

1. Make sure you're using the exact same compiler version that was used to deploy the contract
2. Make sure you're using the exact same optimization settings that were used to deploy the contract
3. Make sure you're providing the correct constructor arguments in the correct format
4. Make sure you're providing the correct libraries if your contract uses any

## API Endpoints for Verified Contracts

Once your contract is verified, you can access the following endpoints:

- **Check if Contract is Verified**: `GET /contracts/{address}/verified`
- **Get Contract ABI**: `GET /contracts/{address}/abi`
- **Get Contract Source Code**: `GET /contracts/{address}/source`
- **Get Contract Verification Details**: `GET /contracts/{address}/verification`
- **Interact with Contract**: `POST /contracts/{address}/interact`

These endpoints can be used to interact with your verified contract through the Studio blockchain explorer.
